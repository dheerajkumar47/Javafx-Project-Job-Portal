# CPU Scheduling Simulator using JavaFX

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator implemented using JavaFX. It allows users to simulate different CPU scheduling algorithms, including Shortest Job First (SJF), First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin, and Priority-based scheduling.

## Features

- Choose from various CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Input dummy data or customize your own data set.
- Calculate average turnaround time and average waiting time.
- Visualize the CPU scheduling process with automatically generated Gantt charts.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dheerajkumar47/Javafx-Project-Job-Portal.git
